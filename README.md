# Chatomus
Exerimental self-hosted instant messaging with zero dependencies.

## Status
Gathering facts, ongoing research. Nothing to try out yet.

## Aims
Chatomus aims to be a lightweight, standalone IM server for individuals (and maybe teams) who want to own their data.

Some of the (still evolving) aims are below. Some of these are long term and will not feature in the alpha version.

### User facing

- Single, independant executables with no dependencies available for all major platforms. Running the server is as simple as running the executable. Eg: `./chatomus config.yaml`
- A bundled, canonical web interface for all actions including administrative tasks.


### Technical
- Transport over HTTP (and Websockets).
- JSON payloads.
